# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Rejection Feedback

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](file:///Users/raul.alzate/Documents/maestria/dev-prescreening/specs/022-ai-rejection-feedback/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification is ready. It defines a mentored approach to rejection feedback using AI, ensuring candidates receive value even if they don't pass the pre-screening.
- Success criteria are measurable (time-to-display, skill mentions, tone consistency).
