# Data Model: Historical AI Form Analysis Results

## Entities

### FormAnalysis
Represents a single successful run of the AI form analysis.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER | Primary Key, Auto-increment |
| form_id | TEXT | The ID of the form template being analyzed |
| analysis_text | TEXT | The Markdown content generated by the AI |
| score | INTEGER | The total score obtained |
| total_possible | INTEGER | The maximum possible score for the form |
| percentage | INTEGER | The calculated affinity percentage |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Creation time (UTC) |

## Relationships
- `FormAnalysis` links to a form template via `form_id`. Since form templates are currently file-based, this is a soft reference.

## Validation Rules
- `form_id` must not be empty.
- `analysis_text` must be valid Markdown (non-empty).
- `percentage` should be between 0 and 100.
